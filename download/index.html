      <h3>Roblox Shaders Mods</h3>
                      <p>Roblox Shaders are a graphics intensive mod that enhance the quality of Roblox. They allow users to
                    have really high graphics quality while still being able to play the game. These are the absolute
                    best presets out there, you can't find better!<bl><br><br>Keep in mind that shaders do take a toll on your
                    overall performance, however, it isn't severe.<bl> Shader mods have been one of the most popular and
                    only mods to have been made for Roblox. These mods give the user an opportunity to add more
                    adjustable visual effects that are not available in stock Roblox.<bl><br><br>Effects are oftentimes
                    controllable through a GUI. You may also put full graphics, then it would add blenders.</p>

      <h3>How to install the shaders :)</h3>
   <p>1. Download Extravi's ReShade Preset.<br>
     2. Open the setup file.<br>
     3. Click browse.<br>
     4. Run the installer.<br>
     5. Perfect! You're set!<br>
     6. To toggle the shaders, the hotkeys are F8 OR FN + F8 and F7<br></p>
      <h3>Things to keep in mind when running shaders:</h3>
    <p>1. Using shaders WILL take a toll on overall performance, especially on less powerful systems. At least a GeForce GTX 1050 Ti or Radeon RX570 are recommended for consistently tolerable performance.<br><br>
      2. Using this will not get you banned since they do not actually modify any code, and thus Roblox cannot detect them. There have been no known recorded cases of people getting banned for using ReShade or other shader mods.
      <br><br>
      3. If performance mode is disabled, you can customize almost every effect which allows for much more customization.
      <br><br>
      4. ReShade must be reinstalled every time Roblox updates. This is due to file location changes.
